### Filters and Finding Patterns
- Normalized Correlation can be used to find templates in the image
- ReLu vs Sigmoid
- ReLu (non linearity), perceptron is a block which takes a bunch of inputs, weight them, and add them up
- A convolution is a stacked input window as vector and sum of the input times weights is a convolution but it isn't non linear
- A multilayer perceptron contains non linearity
- Non linearity is important to model functions like quadratic or cubic without overfitting
- Non linearity creates multiple layers otherwise you can just use a single layer babes
- Convolutional filters are ...
- Non linear filter is for example minimum and maximum filters
- Median filter is non linear and hella nice for salt and pepper pictures

### Edges
- An edge is a sharp change in brightness
- Ideal edge is a step function in a certain direction
- Derivative Filters...
- Use them to take derivatives to find edges
