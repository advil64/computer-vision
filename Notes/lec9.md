### 3D Images
- How can we recover a 3D image from a 2D image?
- Euclidean geometry describes shapes as they are
- Projective geometry describes objects as they appear
- Look at the train track image in the ppt for an example and 2 more examples
- A parallax shift is the displacement of objects due to the viewing angle it is one of the problems with euclidean geometry
- Something about coordinates in 3D and 2D
- Goddamn I stopped paying attention for like an hour
